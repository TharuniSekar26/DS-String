Given two strings 'str1' and 'str2', check if these two strings are isomorphic to each other.

Two strings str1 and str2 are called isomorphic if there is a one to one mapping possible for every character of str1 to every character of str2 while preserving the order.

Note: All occurrences of every character in ‘str1’ should map to the same character in ‘str2

Input:

str1 = aab

str2 = xxy

Output: 1

Explanation: There are two different

charactersin aab and xxy, i.e a and b

with frequency 2and 1 respectively.
